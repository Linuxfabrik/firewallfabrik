.. note::

   The network discovery features described in this chapter (SNMP-based object discovery, importing from /etc/hosts files, and importing existing firewall configurations) are not yet available in FirewallFabrik.

   To populate your object tree, you can:

   * Create objects manually using the GUI (see :doc:`05 - Working with Objects`).
   * Open an existing Firewall Builder file (.fwb) -- FirewallFabrik will import all objects from it.
